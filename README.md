# Worndpress

A satirical fork of the Open Source project [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/).

## Why?

WordPress is an amazing project built as a collaboration of contributors from around the globe.
While the majority of project decisions are made with the goal of improving WordPress, some decisions
are made in a top-down manner and go against the general betterment of the project.

As a satirical fork, Worndpress provides an opportunity to highlight some of these decisions and showcase what these
more community driven choices would look like.
